# Classify Images Into Either Bosnas/Kebaps

> AKT3-Project: Peter Sellner, Marcel Hasieber

This model is trained using a small (~60 images) manually aggregated dataset of images of Bosnas and Kebaps.
It classifies new images based on these classes.
Code and docs can be found in the provided [Jupyter Notebook](./bosna_or_kebap.ipynb).
Two models can be executed using the `USE_BASE_MODEL` flag at the top of the notebook.
